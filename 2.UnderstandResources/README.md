Summary or Take away :

1) Android invokes the resource folder by name and can look up for a specific or default resource basing on availability .

2) Adding qualifiers to resource folder names distinguishes the default resources from a specific resource

3) For example with layout orientation ; layout is default resources location how ever specific resocureces can be maintained for

portrait or landscape orientation .

4) We can use android studio to create these specific resources .

5) Locale and language specific management with resources having language specific qualifiers 

6) Emulator can be used to test custom resource configuration .

7) A simple layout creation using layout editor and make layout editor dependent on resources than hard-coding the values.

8) Accessing views in java and using R.java to find and set values for a view.
